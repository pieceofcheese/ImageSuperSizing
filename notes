Super-Resolution three categories

interpolation
- basically using the mean/average of nearby pixels
reconstruction
- multiframe SR mostly
- 
learning
- yang et. al 2010 "Image super-resolution via sparse representation"
  - sparse dictionary
  - isn't this a lookup table????
  - We have some signal x that is representable by some Da0 where a0 is some small set of elements, and D is a dictionary. x = Da0
  - y is almost equal to a function L applied to x. y = Lx = LDa0
  - The goal is to make two dictionaries, Dh and Dl such that y = Dla0 and x = DHa0
  - equation 4
    - we're trying to find a set a of representations for y
  - equation 7
    - The goal is to find an a such that both 4, and 7 are satisfied
    - the addition is putting a limit on the errors in overlap between the sparse sets
  - Enforcing global reconstruction constraint
    - some sort of gradient descent to ensure that the final image matches the original
    - this part is just for mathy correctness me thinks. We can't possibly know S or H
  - Training a single dictionary
    - D is a dictionary with size K, where K is a hyper parameter?
    - Z is the representation set (set of a)
    - X is the original image
  - Training with the images?


X and Y denote high and low res images
x, y denote image patches
Bold uppercase D for dictionary
Dh and Dl to dentoe high and low resolution image patches
Bold lowercase letters denote vectors
Plain uppercase letters denote matrices
Plain lowercase are scalars
